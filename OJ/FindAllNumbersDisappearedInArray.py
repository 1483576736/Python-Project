"""
Given an array of integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n (n = size of array), some elements appear twice and others appear once.
Find all the elements of [1, n] inclusive that do not appear in this array.
Could you do it without extra space and in O(n) runtime? You may assume the returned list does not count as extra space.

简单翻译：设计一个处理返回列表，运行时间O(n)，空间为0；找到整数数组中在1到N(n是数组长度)数列中没有出现的数字
Input:
[4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]

Output:
[5,6]
