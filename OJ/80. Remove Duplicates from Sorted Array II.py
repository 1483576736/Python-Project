Follow up for "Remove Duplicates":
What if duplicates are allowed at most twice?
一个有序数组，要求最多重复出现两次，超出的要删除
For example,
Given sorted array nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3],
Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.
